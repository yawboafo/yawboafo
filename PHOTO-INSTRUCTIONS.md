# Professional Photo Setup

## 📸 Add Your Professional Photo

To add your professional photo to the hero section:

1. **Prepare Your Photo:**
   - Use a high-quality professional headshot
   - Recommended dimensions: 800x800px or 1000x1000px (square)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading

2. **Add the Photo:**
   - Save your photo as `profile-photo.jpg` in the root directory
   - Or rename it to match the filename in `index.html` (currently `profile-photo.jpg`)

3. **Alternative: Use a Different Filename**
   If you want to use a different filename, update line in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Yaw Koranteng Boafo - Engineering Manager" />
   ```
   Change `profile-photo.jpg` to your filename, e.g., `yaw-photo.jpg`

## 🎨 Photo Styling

The photo will be displayed with:
- Rounded corners (modern aesthetic)
- Subtle gradient overlay
- Premium shadow effect
- Responsive sizing
- Floating leadership indicator cards

## 📝 Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your photo, the hero will show a placeholder. The site will still look professional, but adding your photo will complete the premium executive look.

## ✅ After Adding Your Photo

1. Commit the photo to git:
   ```bash
   git add profile-photo.jpg
   git commit -m "Add professional photo"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Railway will automatically deploy with your photo
3. Your site will be live at https://yawboafo.com

**Note:** Make sure your photo presents you professionally as an Engineering Manager and technical leader.
